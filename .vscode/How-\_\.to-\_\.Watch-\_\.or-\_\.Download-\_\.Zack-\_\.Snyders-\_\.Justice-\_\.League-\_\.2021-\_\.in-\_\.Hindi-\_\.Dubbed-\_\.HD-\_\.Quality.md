Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) is not only a longer and darker version of the theatrical cut, but also a film that is full of interesting trivia and behind-the-scenes stories. Here are some of them:

- Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) contains no shots filmed by Joss Whedon from the theatrical version of Justice League (2017). According to Zack Snyder, he has never actually seen the theatrical cut, as his wife Deborah Snyder and his friend Christopher Nolan advised him to never see it, as it would "break his heart".[^1^]
- The film features a cameo by Jared Leto as The Joker, who did not appear in the theatrical version. Leto reprised his role from Suicide Squad (2016), but with a different look and personality. He also shares a scene with Ben Affleck's Batman for the first time in the DC Extended Universe.[^1^]
- The film restores the original storyline and character arc of Victor Stone/Cyborg, played by Ray Fisher. Cyborg was originally described as the "heart of the movie" by Zack Snyder and Deborah Snyder, but Joss Whedon cut most of his scenes for the theatrical version. Cyborg's plot line involves his relationship with his father Silas Stone, played by Joe Morton, who also played Miles Dyson in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), another scientist who sacrificed himself to save humanity from a technological threat.[^1^]
- The film also features more scenes with Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash, including his introduction to Iris West, played by Kiersey Clemons, who was cut from the theatrical version. The Flash also has a more pivotal role in the final battle, as he uses his speed force to reverse time and prevent Darkseid's invasion.[^1^]
- The film introduces Darkseid, the main antagonist of the DC Comics universe, who was absent from the theatrical version. Darkseid is voiced by Ray Porter, who was originally cast by Zack Snyder before being replaced by CiarÃ¡n Hinds as Steppenwolf in the theatrical version. Steppenwolf is also redesigned for this film as Zack Snyder intended to, with a more menacing appearance and voice.[^1^]
- The film features more scenes with Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, including his interaction with Vulko, played by Willem Dafoe, who was cut from the theatrical version. Vulko is Aquaman's mentor and adviser in Atlantis, who also appears in Aquaman (2018). The film also shows more of Atlantis and its culture, such as the use of air bubbles for communication.[^1^]
- The film features more scenes with Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, including her discovery of the history of Darkseid and the Mother Boxes in an ancient temple. The film also shows more of her warrior side, as she decapitates Steppenwolf in the final battle.[^1^]
- The film features more scenes with Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman, including his resurrection and recovery. The film also shows him wearing a black suit instead of his traditional blue and red suit, which is a homage to his comic book appearance after his death and resurrection. The film also hints at his possible future conflict with Batman and Lois Lane's pregnancy.[^1^]
- The film features more scenes with Amy Adams as Lois Lane, including her grief over Superman's death and her role in bringing him back to his senses. The film also shows her interaction with Martian Manhunter, played by Harry Lennix, who was revealed to be disguised as General Swanwick from Man of Steel (2013) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Martian Manhunter is another member of the Justice League in the comics.[^1^]
- The film features more scenes with Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, Batman's loyal butler and confidant. The film also shows him meeting Superman for the first time and helping Cyborg to hack into the Mother Box.[^1^]
